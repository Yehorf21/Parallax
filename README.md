##AI Leaderboard Landing Page##

A responsive and animated landing page showcasing an AI leaderboard, built with React, Tailwind CSS, and GSAP. This project was created as part of a timed task — focused on clean UI, animation, accessibility, and responsiveness across devices.

##Demo##

[Netlify](https://parallaxbrilliant.netlify.app/)

##Tech Stack##

React – Functional components and JSX

Tailwind CSS – Utility-first styling

GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) – Scroll-based animations

React Router – Navigation and link handling

Custom Components – Reusable button component

ARIA Attributes – Accessibility best practices

Responsive Design – Mobile-first layout with scrollable table

Optional: [MUI DataGrid] was considered but replaced with a custom-built solution for full control

##Features##

Custom Leaderboard Table:
Built from scratch using <table> elements with custom widths, scroll behavior, and row slicing logic.

Scroll-triggered Animations:
GSAP powers multiple animations, including a vector that moves with scroll and a comet that fades in/out while moving.

Gradient Buttons:
Styled with CSS border-image for a clean, vibrant look. Responsive padding based on device size.

Accessible Elements:
All interactive components include aria-labels and alt attributes for better screen reader support.

Responsive Layout:
Designed with overflow-x-auto, media queries, and Tailwind utilities to work on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

I had a lot of fun working on this project and would love to contribute on this level (and higher) to your team and clients. Have a good time reviewing it and a good day!
